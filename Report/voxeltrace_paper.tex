		This project seeks to investigate the viability of implementing a sparse voxel cone tracing technique in a gpu fragment shader for global illumination approximation. The aim is to assess the performance and features of the technique, and to determine if it is suitable for practical use in modern gaming. To accomplish this, a sparse voxel cone tracing based GI renderer will be implemented within the given timeframe and the results will be evaluated. The project will also provide insight into the limitations of the technique and how it can be improved in the future. In the end voxel cone tracing wasn't implemented as the time limit was hit, but raytracing with shadows was implemented in a shader, which showed around a 20-times performance improvement compared to the same code running on the CPU.

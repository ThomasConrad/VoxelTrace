     Graphs are assumed to be stored in a simple format where:
     - each vertex (aka node) is stored on a single line starting with the character 'n' followed
     by three decimal numbers that together give the 3D spatial coordinates of the node.
     - each edge (aka connection) is stored on a line starting with the character 'c' followed by
     two numbers which are interpreted as the indices of the nodes connected by the edge.
     node numbers are assumed to start from 0.
